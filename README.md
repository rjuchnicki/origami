This repository contains a Sublime Text 2 plugin that takes snapshots of
highlighted text with a keystroke, packages the snapshots in a basic markup
format, and exports the contents into a simple, sleek Microsoft Powerpoint
file using the pyPPT Python module. Text that is common to adjacent slides in
the presentation will be highlighted in the second slide by default.

We worked on this project at YHack 2013. Our vision was to create an
educational tool that can be used to present the evolving nature of a
programming project or Computer Science demo in a slide format. However, it
could be useful to quickly produce a presentation in any domain without
interacting with a slideshow editor UI.
